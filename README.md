# Weather-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
An intelligent weather forecasting system that leverages historical weather data and machine learning algorithms to accurately predict temperature, humidity, and air quality index (AQI). Designed as a real-time, desktop-based solution using Python and Tkinter.

## 📌 Overview

Traditional weather forecasting relies on complex numerical models that are slow, resource-heavy, and often inaccurate for short-term, localized predictions.

This project overcomes those limitations by:
- Using machine learning on real historical weather data
- Providing fast, accurate forecasts with minimal resources
- Offering a desktop GUI for easy, interactive predictions
- Making forecasting accessible for education, agriculture, and disaster planning
